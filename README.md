MinestomPvP is an extension for Minestom.
It tries to mimic vanilla PvP as good as possible.
Currently, almost all vanilla PvP features are supported except for a few.

## Usage

To integrate this extension in your minestom server, you may have to tweak a little bit to make sure everything works correctly.
You can get an `EventNode` with all PvP related events listening using `PvpExtension.events()`.
You can add this node as a child to any other node and the pvp will work in the scope.

When applying damage to an entity, use `CustomDamageType` instead of `DamageType` (except if you the the default ones: `GRAVITY`, `ON_FIRE` and `VOID`).
If you have your own damage type, also extend `CustomDamageType` instead of `DamageType`.

## Events

This extension provides several events:

- `DamageBlockEvent`: cancellable, called when an entity blocks damage using a shield.
- `FinalDamageEvent`: cancellable, called when the final damage calculation (including armor and effects) is completed. This event should be used instead of `EntityDamageEvent`, unless you want to detect how much damage was originally dealt.
